## Handwritten Digits Recognition

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AdarshZolekar/Handwritten-Digits-Recognition/blob/main/MNIST-Digits-Recognition.ipynb)

A simple deep learning project using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a basic neural network for image classification.

## Model Architecture

- **Input Layer:** 28x28 pixels (flattened to 784)
- **Hidden Layer:** Dense(128, ReLU)
- **Output Layer:** Dense(10, Softmax)

## Dataset

- Training images: 60,000  
- Test images: 10,000  
- Image size: 28x28 (grayscale)

## Future Improvements

- Switch from a simple dense network to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for higher accuracy 
 
- Add a Streamlit/Gradio app for interactive digit drawing and real-time predictions  

- Deploy model on web/mobile using TensorFlow Lite or Flask API  

- Experiment with additional datasets (letters, symbols) for broader recognition 
 
- Hyperparameter tuning and regularization to reduce overfitting
